#### constituents of regex for finding the first form of amounts in box office information: 

     • \$ - escaped dollar sign
         • \s* - in our second iteration to fix pattern matches, we wanted to look for cases where there might be a space after the dollar sign
     • \d+ - indicate that we want one or more digits, i.e. an arbitrary (but non-zero) number of digits
     • \.? - an optional decimal point
     • \d* - an arbitrary, but *possibly* zero number of digits
     • \s* - a space, maybe more than one
     • [mb]illion - the word 'million' or 'billion'
         • [mb]illi?on - in our second iteration, we changed this to accommodate for cases where 'million' is misspelled as 'millon'



#### constituents of regex for finding the second form of amounts in box office information: 

     • \$ - escaped dollar sign
         • \s* - in our second iteration to fix pattern matches, we wanted to look for cases where there might be a space after the dollar sign
     • \d{1,3} - indicate that we want one to three digits
     • ?:(,\d{3})+ - match a comma followed by exactly three digits; match a repetition of this group by enclosing it in parenthesis and following that up with a plus sign; ensure it is a non-capturing group by adding ?:
         • [,\.] - in our second iteration to fix pattern matches, we wanted to look for cases where a comma or period was used as a thousands separator
     • (?!\s[mb]illion) - in our second iteration to fix pattern matches, we added a negative look ahead group that rejects the match if it finds 'million' or 'billion'
